# Conman's Dictionary

## Overview

Conman's Dictionary is a dictionary application. Currently, it is best
geared for armchair linguists who are working on constructed languages
(hence the name). It probably will not be that good if it's used for
any other purpose. The program shows two word lists at a time
(Language 1 to Language 2, and vice versa). It uses its own XML file
format, and can export the dictionary in the plain text format used by
dictd.

Conman's Dictionary is distributed under GNU General Public License
v3.  The principal developer is Urpo "WWWWolf" Lankinen
([wwwwolf@iki.fi](mailto:wwwwolf@iki.fi)).

## Requirements

The project is developed in Java 6 SE, and is known to work on Sun's
JDK.  Possibly might work on OpenJDK/IcedTea, though I haven't tried
it for a long time.

The project is developed on NetBeans 6.0 (sorry, Debian doesn't have
any newer versions yet) and you probably need the
[Swing Application Framework](https://appframework.dev.java.net/)
if you're not compiling it on NetBeans. Note that
appframeworksification is still very much underway.
