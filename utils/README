This directory contains random script files to handle conversions
from obsolete formats, and possibly to work with dictd-style dictionary
files. Note that these were pretty much developed for one-shot dealies
and are not particularly ingenious or well-tested. Unless otherwise
mentioned, the scripts in this directory are in public domain (not GPL3)
and you accept that you're using them entirely on your risk. -wwwwolf
