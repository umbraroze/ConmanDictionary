## How are things now?

I'm currently **not** soliciting feedback on Conman's Dictionary.
This is not to say that this is a permanent state of affairs!

At this stage, Conman's Dictionary is an app that is developed
specifically for my own particular use case, and it really
serves as a way for me to learn (and re-learn!) the art of
sensible desktop app development.
It was, for me, a way to learn Java development and various
related technologies. Now, it will be a way for me to learn
C# development and various technologies related to that.

Conman's Dictionary is **not**, at this stage, a
serious tool designed for a diverse group of users with
a lot of covered use-cases and lots of user research
into what kind of features the users would potentially need.
Most of the development is based solely on "dang,
wouldn't it be neat if it did *that*" feels.

Over the years, I've received *zero* user feedback of any
kind, as far as I can remember.
I'm pretty sure no one *actually* uses the application.
(But if you do, please let me know!)

So, in summary, as things stand now, I'm reluctant to get
help. Hope you understand.

## How will the things be in the future?

Oh, *maybe* the project will eventually hit the stage when
it  is functional and feels "complete". At least, I'm hopeful
it will hit that level of functionality.

Once the C# version is release-worthy, and hits the same
functional threshold as the Java version had, *maybe* I can
start cautiously advertise the fact that this thing is a thing,
and consider that maybe someone would have further ideas on
how to improve it.

I don't expect this to be a major app that a lot of people use,
but at very least, I hope this will serve as an example of a
nice little desktop app project that anyone can pull off,
with some nice documentation on what exactly went into
creating it.
