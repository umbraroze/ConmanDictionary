# Conman's Dictionary

We're Under Construction! This will eventually host the new and improved website
for **Conman's Dictionary**.

## Overview

Conman's Dictionary is a dictionary application. It is primarily
geared for armchair linguists who are working on constructed languages
(hence the name). It probably will not be that good if it's used for
any other, more serious and more comprehensive use.

The application has two word lists at a time so you can maintain
translations both ways. Both of the lists have headwords and
translations to another language, word classes, and categorisation
options. You can flag words that need attention.

The application uses its own XML file format, and can export the
dictionary in the plain text format used by dictd. (Ostensibly.
I don't actually use dictd, you see; I just need it to be in
plain text format.)

Conman's Dictionary is distributed under the
[GNU General Public License version 3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
It is developed by Rose Midford, primarily for the Avarthrel
worldbuilding project.
