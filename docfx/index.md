# Conman's Dictionary

This is the [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) documentation thing for
Conman's Dictionary. There's not really all that much information here that
will not also be in the main website (if you need the source of that stuff,
see the top-level `docs` folder).

To view these docs, run `docfx` with:

```console
> docfx docfx.json --serve
```
